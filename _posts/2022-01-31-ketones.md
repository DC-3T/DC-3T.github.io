Our new article, titled <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.793987/full" target="_blank">Evaluation of Acute Supplementation With the Ketone Ester deltaG in Healthy Volunteers by Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</a>, has just been published in Frontiers in Physiology as part of the Research Topic "New Views on Old Molecules: MR Spectroscopic Techniques & Insights on Physiology". Here's a brief synopsis of the research:

<p class="message">
In this acute intervention study, we investigated the potential benefit of ketone supplementation in humans by studying cardiac <abbr title="phosphocreatine">PCr</abbr> to <abbr title="adenosine-triphosphate">ATP</abbr> ratios and skeletal muscle <abbr title="phosphocreatine">PCr</abbr> recovery using <abbr title="phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy">31P-MRS</abbr> before and after ingestion of a ketone ester drink. We recruited 28 healthy adults: 12 age 23–70 for cardiac <abbr title="phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy">31P-MRS</abbr>, and 16 age 60–75 for muscle <abbr title="phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy">31P-MRS</abbr>. Baseline and post-intervention <abbr title="phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy">31P-MRS</abbr> scans were performed in one visit, where 25 g of the ketone monoester, deltaG®, was administered after the baseline scan. Post-intervention <abbr title="phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy">31P-MRS</abbr> was timed 30 min after deltaG® ingestion. In blood samples, post-intervention glucose, lactate and non-esterified fatty acids decreased (−28.8%, −28.2%, and −49.1%, respectively), while ketone body D-beta-hydroxybutyrate increased from mean (<abbr title="standard deviation">SD</abbr>) 0.7 (0.3) to 4.0 (1.1) mmol/L. Cardiac <abbr title="phosphocreatine">PCr</abbr>/<abbr title="adenosine-triphosphate">ATP</abbr> and muscle metabolic parameters did not change. Acute ketone supplementation caused mild ketosis in blood, with drops in glucose, lactate, and free fatty acids; however, these changes were not associated with <abbr title="phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy">31P-MRS</abbr> measures in heart or muscle. Future work may investigate longer-term ketone supplementation on tissue energetics in groups with compromised mitochondrial function.
