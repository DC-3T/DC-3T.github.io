<p class="message">
  I am an expert in musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy with a background in physics and a long-
standing interest in muscle, muscle diseases, and the effect of ageing on muscle function. I am currently
seeking to establish myself as an independent researcher in the Netherlands and, to that end, I am now working full-time
in the Medical Imaging department at Radboudumc, Nijmegen.
